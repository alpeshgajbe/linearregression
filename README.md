# Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction

> This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The model helps the bike-sharing company BoomBikes understand how various factors influence bike demand, which can guide their business strategy in a post-pandemic scenario.

## General Information
- This project analyzes the factors that influence the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The aim is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate bike demand based on these factors.
- The background of the project stems from BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider that has experienced a drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They want to prepare for an anticipated increase in demand once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.
- The project uses a dataset containing daily records of bike rentals, along with various factors such as weather conditions, season, temperature, and holiday information.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: The year (2019 vs. 2018) is a significant predictor of bike demand, with demand increasing in 2019.
- Conclusion 2: Weather conditions significantly impact demand, with poorer weather (e.g., mist, light snow/rain) leading to a decrease in bike rentals.
- Conclusion 3: Perceived temperature (atemp) has a strong positive correlation with bike demand, indicating higher usage in warmer conditions.
- Conclusion 4: The spring season is associated with a lower demand for bikes compared to other seasons, possibly due to less favorable weather conditions.
